{"name":"Vaporos-mod","tagline":"VaporOS","body":"# VaporOS-mod\r\nThis is the new format of VaporOS, a Stephenson's Rocket mod.\r\n\r\nTo build VaporOS you'll need to first clone Stephenson's rocket's git repo:\r\n\r\n    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/steamos-community/stephensons-rocket.git --branch alchemist\r\n\r\nAfter you've done that move into the newly created directory and clone this repo like this:\r\n\r\n    cd stephensons-rocket\r\n    git clone https://github.com/sharkwouter/vaporos-mod.git\r\n\r\nNow you can build VaporOS like this:\r\n\r\n    cd ..\r\n    ./gen.sh -n \"VaporOS\" vaporos-mod\r\n\r\nThat's it, good luck!\r\n\r\nVaporOS still has all the features found in the last version, but now you also get support for older hardware like found in Stephenson's Rocket. You'll also get new additions to Stephenson's Rocket through updates.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
